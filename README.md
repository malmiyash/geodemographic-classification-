Spatial and temporal geodemographic analysis in Leicestershire using R

This repository contains code and analysis for my MSc thesis in Geographical Data Science (submission: October 2024).  
The project investigates spatial and temporal changes in demographic patterns in Leicestershire, focusing on migration settlemets.  
Both K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering techniques were applied using R to classify geodemographic data.
